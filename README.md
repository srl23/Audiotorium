# PLEASE READ ME

When signing up, users do not need to use a valid email address. This is because this is a small project that was never intended to be commercial, but as a project that was made in class over at General Assembly. It will not email you either, as there is no framework in place to actually do that set up to do so.

This is a project that was made using Ruby on Rails with some JavaScript, ERB,
and CSS styling. It is a social listening chat app where users listen to music
or other audio and chat about it together by typing their message into the
input bar and then pressing the enter key to send it.

The most challenging part of this whole project was trying to teach myself Ruby
 on Rails once again. In the past, I tried to learn Rails and it did not go as well
 as I'd have hoped and when I found out we had to learn a new language or framework
 to perform our next project, I decided I wanted to finish this unresolved business
 of mine and acquire a skill I wanted for a couple of years. It was kind of personal and I had an interest in acquiring competency in Ruby on Rails. I feel a new drive to work with this language again having a success with it at long last!

As a result, I did not manage to get much work done at all for the first few days, as I
was watching a lot of videos, seeking out help, and learning how the libraries all worked whilst consulting the documentation constantly. My brain felt like mush and still kind of does (as of this writing on 4/26/2020 at 10pm EST).

The features include: chat rooms that can be created, the creator of the room can decide what song the users are listening to, songs autoplay on browsers that support it,
the chat scrolls down so the most recent message is visible using the power of flex box and column reverse, and the users may sign up for accounts as well as edit their information or even delete it should they wish to.

I was originally planning on including file uploads but it felt like it was a lot of trouble with all I have managed to get done at the point in time this was due. I did not realize what an undertaking this was at first! I feel overall quite satisfied with it, not too pleased with the basic 90s looking styling but there's always time to improve it little by little and make it closer to my original vision. It supports two songs which are definitely public domain, "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin and "Moonlight Sonata" by Ludwig van Beethoven. I was going to include a bunch of Incompetech songs but it would have bloated the project to ridiculous sizes and I fear Heroku would not let me host this without paying them to do so. This was quite fun to work on towards the end when this was all starting to come together and the music was playing.

I look forward to my next Rails app!
